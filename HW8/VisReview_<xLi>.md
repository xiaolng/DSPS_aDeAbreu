Review:

Hi Allie,

This is an awesome plot. The x and y axes are clearly labeled with units. The legend is at right position. Expecially, I like the dash line plot of MLLW.  A few comments, 

- the plot may look better if we labeled the time when earthquake occured, which is a critical point;

- why the residual is a line plot while the observed is a scatter plot;

- plot the region within 1-sigma of prediction, so we know how good is our prediction.
